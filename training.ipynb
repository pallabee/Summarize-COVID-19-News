The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion.

       " ['The Pathogen Behind China’s Pneumonia Outbreak January 9, 2020\\nBEIJING : Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.',\n",

Vaccinate against scour\\nCalf rearing on farms can be very labour intensive, particularity if there is a scour outbreak. Rotavirus is the most common cause of calf scour, which usually affects calves when they are between five and 14 days old. Also Read: Should I vaccinate my suckler cows against calf scour?\\nWhere it is an issue, or if there is a risk of it becoming an issue, a one-shot vaccine can be given between three and 12 weeks before calving, which ensures that the cow’s colostrum contains antibodies that protect against three of the main causes of scour – rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli. Take soil samples\\nNow is an ideal time to take soil samples. Anyone who doesn’t have a set of up-to-date soil samples should be taking samples presently or in the near future.\\nIt is important to note that soil tests should be no greater than five-years old. Some farmers will take samples more regularly than this, but all should aim to take samples every three-to-five years. Advertisement\\nOnce soil sample results are returned, a fertiliser plan for the coming year can be drawn up. This will take the guesswork out of the amount or type of fertiliser to purchase in the spring. Get calving season ready\\nThere is not long left until calving season kicks off on many spring-calving dairy farms; so it is time to get your ducks in a row.\\nBy now, all calving and calf sheds should be cleaned out and disinfected with any necessary adjustments to sheds made.

Six more people have been admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong after developing respiratory symptoms on their return from the mainland Chinese city of Wuhan, health authorities said on Friday. It brought the number of suspected cases in the city to 54. A new coronavirus strain was revealed by mainland health authorities on Thursday to be the cause of the mystery pneumonia outbreak in the central Chinese city, where 59 people have been infected since December. In Hong Kong, six more people who recently returned from Wuhan showed either symptoms of fever and respiratory infection or pneumonia. The new cases – reported between Thursday noon and midday on Friday – included two three-year-old girls and a four-year-old boy. Four were already found to be infected with flu or other known viruses. So far, 31 of the 54 suspected cases in the city have already been discharged. Hu Ke, a respiratory medicine professor from Hubei General Hospital who had treated patients in Wuhan, told mainland Chinese media on Friday that most patients’ conditions were “mild to moderate”. “Conditions of patients in general come under control after treatment,” Hu said, adding that most patients who were still in hospital remained stable. He said that more than 90 per cent of the patients had a fever at the early stage of the disease, and around 15 per cent had difficulty breathing. Infectious diseases expert Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, from the University of Hong Kong, predicted that the risk of the disease spreading from Wuhan – one of mainland China’s largest transport hubs – during the Lunar New Year’s mass movement of people would be small. This year’s migration began on Friday, two weeks ahead of the festival at the end of January. Yuen’s prediction was based on information released by the mainland that no evidence had been found of a human to human transmission. “Avian flu, 99 per cent of the time, is transmitted to humans from live birds at markets,” Yuen told a radio programme on Friday morning. He said if the transmission route of the Wuhan virus was the same as avian flu, the risk of transmission should be “low”. Yuen added that the genetic information of the virus, which the mainland authorities said on Thursday that they had obtained, could allow Hong Kong experts to develop a quick test that could diagnose the virus in two to three hours, much shorter than the current method that takes six to eight hours. The Centre for Health Protection said it was still waiting for a reply from the National Health Commission after asking for virus information, including its genetic sequence. “We have to accept that the genetic information belongs to [the mainland], when they provide it to us is their decision,” he said. Speaking on the same radio programme, microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung reiterated that tracing the source of the unknown Wuhan virus was crucial to understand the features of the virus. Ho also said mainland Chinese authorities must thoroughly improve sanitation at wet markets or risk similar coronaviruses spreading in Wuhan and other parts of China.',\n",

It is causing a lot of concern among mothers in my practice and community as they are posting “my son has coronavirus”. Of course that leads to a Google search and the next thing you know I have parents calling concerned about SARS! (a rare complication). Coronavirus (which is named for the crown like shape of the viral particles under a microscope) is just another fall and winter virus that typically causes cold like symptoms with a scratchy throat, congestion, runny nose and cough. It may also cause several days of fever. Coronavirus “acts” like many of the other viruses that we are seeing now, including rhinovirus and parainfluenza. While most everyone gets a coronavirus infection in their lifetime, knowing the name of the virus really doesn’t change anything about the treatment. Having your child’s nose or throat swabbed and sent for a fairly expensive test so that “you may have peace of mind” does not dictate any different treatment than that of any other respiratory virus. Symptomatic relief has been the advice for treating all of these upper respiratory infections….long before we could test for them in an office setting. How do you treat it? Treat the fever if there is one and do not send your child to daycare or school until they have been fever free for 24 hours (you also need to stay home if you have a fever). Use over the counter saline nose drops to help suction your child’s nose or to help thin the mucous so that they can “blow” more effectively. Take a steamy shower to relieve the congestion and loosen the cough. Use a cool mist humidifier in your child’s room (especially if you have the heat running). Make sure to teach your children how to “cough into their elbow” rather than their hands. I am continuing to hold a lot of hands as parents worry about all of these different respiratory viruses….but naming them is not going to change treatment in the otherwise healthy child. Making sure your child washes their hands and try to teach your older children to keep their hands away from their eyes, nose and mouth will serve you better than worrying about which virus they may have been exposed to. In the case of any illness, if you become concerned about how your child is breathing and respiratory distress, you need to place an immediate call to your pediatrician or a visit to the ER. Do not be soconcerned about naming the illness.',\n",

       " ['An unidentified form of viral pneumonia has struck several dozen people in the Chinese city of Wuhan, sparking concerns that the country may be facing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\\nBack in 2002 and 2003, SARS spread to 26 countries, infecting more than 8,000 people with a severe, flu-like illness and claiming more than 750 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak began in China, where 349 people died from the disease on the mainland and 299 more perished in Hong Kong, according to Asian news channel CNA . The SARS virus spreads through person-to-person contact and can be expelled from an infected individual when they cough or sneeze, contaminating both people and nearby objects. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that China was free of SARS in 2004, but now, a mysterious bout of viral illness has led to speculation that the disease is back.\\nForty-four cases of the unidentified illness have been reported so far, including 11 \"severe\" cases, according to the international news agency AFP . Many of the infected individuals were stall holders at Wuhan\\'s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which health authorities have closed until further notice, according to the South China Morning Post . In a further effort to contain the outbreak, airports in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan have ramped up screenings for fever among their passengers.\\nRelated: The 9 Deadliest Viruses on Earth\\nThe cause of the infections remains unknown, but the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has ruled out \"influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases\" as potential culprits, according to TK. \"At this point, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak,\" said Gauden Galea, WHO\\'s representative in China, AFP reported.\\nIn response to speculation about a SARS outbreak, the Wudan police announced Wednesday (Jan. 1) that eight individuals had been punished for \"publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification,\" the AFP added.\\n\"If it were SARS, we are experienced in managing it,\" Emily Chan Ying-yang, a medical professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a visiting professor at the University of Oxford, told the South China Morning Post. \"But if it is a new strain, then we should pay attention.\"\\nDuring the 2002 outbreak, SARS caused many fatalities among young people, so it\\'s important to determine whether serious cases of the virus are occurring in young or elderly individuals, she added.\\nThe mystery pneumonia may also be caused by a rare virus or one that was previously unknown, Dr. Jiang Rongmeng of Beijing Ditan Hospital told the South China Morning Post.\\nUnlike in the 2002 SARS outbreak, \"no apparent human-to-human transmission has been detected so far. Otherwise, there would have been a community outbreak with more infections,\" Rongmeng added.',\n",

       " [\"Scientists in China think they’ve made a break in the case of a mystery disease that’s caused pneumonia in dozens of people. In several patients, they’ve found a virus never before discovered—albeit one related to the viruses responsible for causing SARS and other respiratory illnesses.\\nOn Thursday, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported on the results of a preliminary investigation into the outbreak, which has so far sickened 59 people and left seven in serious condition. In 15 people, scientists say they’ve identified a strong suspect for the illness: a previously unknown type of coronavirus.\\nCoronaviruses are a family of spiky ball-shaped viruses known to infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Most coronaviruses that make people sick cause nothing more than a typical cold. But in recent decades, we’ve come across two more dangerous and sometimes lethal viruses—the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and the one that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.\\nEarlier this week, the Chinese government stated that the mystery disease was not SARS, following weeks of accusations by its own residents on social media that the government was once again hiding the truth about a SARS outbreak within its borders. According to the Chinese government, no victims have tested positive for other likely culprits either, such as bird flu, while the mystery virus’s genetics have been completely sequenced, ruling out the possibility it’s SARS, MERS, or any other known coronavirus.\\nAt this point, the research team’s work has yet to be confirmed independently. But on Wednesday, the World Health Organisation expressed early confidence that the mystery disease could be caused by a coronavirus, based on reports so far.\\nThe first human outbreaks of a never-before-seen infection, including SARS and MERS, tend to be zoonotic, meaning they’re initially spread from animals to people (for SARS, it was likely rodents or bats; for MERS, camels). That seems to be the case for this new coronavirus, too. The majority of cases have involved people working at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, where many live animals are kept.\\nSometimes, these new viruses are already capable of spreading easily from person to person, or can quickly mutate into a more contagious strain. But at least right now, that’s not true for the mystery bug, since no cases of person-to-person transmission have been reported yet. It also doesn’t seem to be as lethal as SARS or MERS, as no patients have died. But there’s still plenty of questions about the virus left to be answered, including where it first emerged.

According to the WHO, the patient is a 74-year-old male owner of a camel farm with underlying illnesses living in the UAE. Before the onset of symptoms, he had no history of recent travel and had not been involved in the slaughtering of animals, but had a history of close contact with camels. The patient is now receiving treatment in an intensive care unit. He is in a stable condition. According to the WHO, this is the second MERS case reported from the UAE since June 2018. Since 2012, the UAE has reported 89 MERS cases (including the patient reported above), among which 12 patients had passed away. \"We will maintain close communication with the WHO and relevant health authorities,\" a spokesman for the CHP said. \"As countries in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, continue to report MERS cases from time to time, travellers should refrain from going to farms, barns or markets with camels and avoid contact with sick persons and animals, especially camels, birds or poultry. Most of the cases reported in the Middle East had a history of exposure to camels, consumption of camel milk or contact with other MERS patients,\" the spokesman said. \"Scientific evidence showed that camels are reservoirs for MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Camels infected with MERS-CoV may not show any signs of infection. Infected animals may shed MERS-CoV through nasal and eye discharge and faeces, and potentially in their milk and urine. The virus may also be found in the raw organs and meat of infected animals. Therefore, the best protection is to practise good hygiene and avoid direct contact with all of these,\" the spokesman added. From time to time, suspected MERS cases reported to the CHP for investigation involve patients with a history of contact with camels in the Middle East. The CHP strongly advises travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to abstain from arranging camel rides and activities involving direct contact with camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS page of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP\\'s Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the WHO\\'s latest news for more information and health advice.

Photo by AFP. Vietnam’s Health Ministry has listed several steps for people to protect themselves from a new pneumonia virus that had killed one in China. In a statement released Saturday, the ministry advised residents to keep their distance from people with acute respiratory infections and wear a mask when talking to them. Keeping bodies warm, maintaining personal hygiene, especially cleaning hands regularly with soap and gargling with antiseptic rinse are other steps to take against the virus, it said. People should also cover their mouths and noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing so as to avoid spreading their respiratory tract fluid, and avoid staying close to animal farms or wild animals, it added. Those returning from China’s Wuhan City, where the outbreak has been raging since the beginning of the year, should have their health checked immediately if they catch a fever, cough or have difficulties in breathing, the ministry said. So far, 41 Chinese people in Wuhan have been infected with the virus, which has been identified as a new type of coronavirus by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. One 61-year-old man has died. The man, the first victim of the outbreak, was a regular customer at a seafood market in the city, had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease, local health authorities said. It also noted that the infected people were mainly vendors and buyers at the seafood market. To date, no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found. The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak. While no infection has been recorded to date in Vietnam, Vietnamese health authorities have begun to check those coming in from China through the border gates. Any person found with noticeable symptoms should be quarantined, they have said. Related News:',\n",

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn\\'t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\\nThe name comes from the Latin word \\'corona,\\' meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it\\'s possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n\\'Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,\\' Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\\n___\\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

This all sounds pretty rough, but there’s actually some good news in the latest report from the South China Morning Post .\\nThe illness is believed to be a new strain of the coronavirus, according to health officials in China. There have been no reports of deaths related to the infections, and it doesn’t appear as though the outbreak is particularly contagious. Nevertheless, Chinese authorities are monitoring relatives of those who came down with the sickness in order to get the jump on new infections if they should arise.\\nThe good news is that many of the suspected cases have already been resolved, with over 30 of the nearly 60 cases having been discharged. Early symptoms include trouble breathing and fevers, but conditions improve rapidly after treatment, according to health officials.\\nThere have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, which is great news. Some of the most serious outbreaks to happen in China, including illnesses like bird flu, were animal-to-human transmissions. This new sickness hasn’t spread particularly fast, and Chinese authorities are working on developing a test to diagnose the virus within hours.\\nAt the moment, there’s no reason to panic, even if you’re living in China and happen to be near the area where the infections are popping up.

Health authorities in city of Wuhan said the man who died had complications including chronic liver disease and abdominal tumours and was a frequent visitor to a food market on the city’s outskirts where the outbreak is believed to have started in December. There are fears the virus has already spread as Wuhan has a high population density and is a travel hub for central China. Possible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent visitors to Wuhan. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . China’s transport ministry said it plans to disinfect trains, planes and buses during the 40-day travel rush centred on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls on 25 January. The ministry’s chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference: “The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period. “In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations.”',\n",

They are expected to end their two-day trip today. The team will consist of Lam Chong, director of the Disease Control Center of the Health Bureau (SSM), and two officials from the public hospital, the government reported on Sunday. According to a statement issued yesterday by the Government Information Bureau, the team will be informed by national health officials about the appropriate treatment for infected patients, as well as measures to prevent or if necessary control the spread of the identified coronavirus. The SSM’s Public Health Laboratory already has diagnostic tests that can detect if a patient has been infected with the pathogen identified in the Wuhan outbreak. As of Sunday, all patients suspected of having symptoms of pneumonia – and whose preliminary test results exclude the possibility of regular influenza – were subjected to these diagnostic tests. The government additionally received on Sunday a notice from the mainland’s National Health Commission stating that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus associated with the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, had been released through the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data. Since 1 January, local medical institutions have informed the health authority and other relevant government departments about a total of 10 cases, each involving a patient with fever and respiratory problems, and that had been in Wuhan in the previous 14 days. Tests have ruled out the possibility of the Wuhan coronavirus in eight of the patients, while two remain in isolation for further testing. The government is paying close attention to the latest developments regarding the viral pneumonia cases that have occurred in Wuhan and has taken several measures to minimize the risk of such cases having any impact on Macau. The city continues to advance local preparedness regarding response to a potential viral outbreak, including a uniform level of training in relation to the control of infectious disease and procedures of handling suspicious cases for medical professionals. The SSM has also worked to ensure that there is sufficient reserve supply of medication, medical consumables and other equipment. The government stressed again yesterday that there is no cause for alarm regarding the outbreak in Wuhan. Nonetheless, a heightened level of awareness should be displayed by members of the public and greater attention given to the maintenance of personal and environmental hygiene. Macau residents either working, studying or living in Wuhan should remain additionally vigilant, it said. DB',\n",

In total, it is estimated to have cost about $59 billion, including a drop in tourism revenue (-80% in China) and a 50% loss of revenue for airlines, tour operators, restaurants and taxi drivers. During this period, Southeast Asia experienced a drop in GDP of about 2%.\\nFollowing this tragedy, international regulations were adopted to force countries to report any new emerging infectious diseases that could spread rapidly and cross borders.

Chinese health authorities did not immediately confirm the report from state broadcaster CCTV. Coronaviruses are spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person. Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness. The novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend. Patients in four locations As of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days. Laboratory experts as of Wednesday evening had found the novel coronavirus in 15 of the 59 cases, CCTV said, adding that more research must be done before a conclusion is reached. Possible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan. Since the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority said Wednesday. No serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan. None of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients operated businesses. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan’s health commission said. A Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan. Fears of SARS, MERS The new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004. Another coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. That outbreak started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years. On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonialike illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.

Initial test results point to a new type of coronavirus as the cause of the outbreak, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses and are named for the crown-like spikes projecting from their surfaces, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This family includes the viruses that cause SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), as well as viruses that cause more mild illness, like the common cold. New coronaviruses pop up from time to time in different parts of the world. For example, SARS emerged in China in 2002, and MERS appeared in Saudi Arabia for the first time in 2012, according to WHO. Doctors discovered the newly identified coronavirus, which has not yet been named, by testing blood samples and throat swabs from 15 people in the outbreak, according to the BBC. So far, the outbreak, which was first reported in late December, has sickened 59 people in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the BBC reported. Ill individuals have experienced symptoms such as fever, body aches, breathing difficulties and lung injury, Live Science previously reported. Questions remain about the source of the virus and how it is transmitted, according to the WHO. So far, there's no evidence that the virus passes from person to person. Several people who fell ill were dealers or vendors at a food market in Wuhan, which was closed on Jan. 1 for disinfection, the WHO said.\\nPrevious Article \",\n",

They said it was responsible for a new pneumonia-like illness that had swept Wuhan since last month, leaving 59 ill and created panic. The researchers described the infectious agent as a “coronavirus”, identified in a hospitalised person with pneumonia in Wuhan.\\nCoronaviruses are a specific family of viruses, with some of them causing less-severe damage, such as the common cold, and others causing respiratory and intestinal diseases. A coronavirus has many “regularly arranged” protrusions on its surface, because of which the entire virus particle looks like an emperor’s crown, hence the name “coronavirus”. Apart from human beings, coronaviruses can affect mammals including pigs, cattle, cats, dogs, martens, camels, hedgehogs and some birds.So far, there are four known disease-causing coronaviruses, among which the best known are the SARS corona virus and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, both of which can cause severe respiratory diseases.\\nIn the newly identified coronavirus, a direct link with the disease has not been established yet. Previously, there was speculation that the mystery illness was related to the SARS epidemic in China in the latter half of 2002 that killed roughly 350 people. Now, the new coronavirus has been detected in over 15 cases so far. No deaths have been reported, nor has any case been reported of human-to-human transmission.\\nAs per state-owned CCTV, the new coronavirus is different from human coronaviruses already known. WHO said in a statement that further investigations are required to determine the source, modes of transmission and extent of infection caused by the new virus.\\nFor all the latest Explained News , download Indian Express App\\nTags: Express Explained 0 Comment(s) * * The moderation of comments is automated and not cleared manually by indianexpress.com.

As of Thursday, a little more than a week later, the number had risen to 59 – with seven in critical condition.\\nNow, it appears public health officials worst fears have been confirmed: Preliminary tests indicate the mysterious illness may be caused by a new coronavirus, according to lead scientist Xu Jianguo, who delivered the news to China’s official Xinhua news agency, according to the BBC.\\nXu said he and his researchers found the “new type” of coronavirus by testing infected blood samples and throat swabs collected from 15 people.\\nCrucially, coronaviruses can be the cause of a wide range of illnesses, from common colds, to infections like the SARS virus that originated in China in 2002 and 2003 and ended up killing 700 people around the world.\\nCourtesy of the BBC\\nBeijing’s confirmation seems to affirm the WHO’s suspicion that a coronavirus could be to blame for the outbreak.\\nWhile identifying the virus type is a start for authorities, “further investigations” are still necessary, said Gauden Galea, The WHO representative for China. For example, pathology investigators still need to understand how the virus spreads.\\nSo far, zero cases of human to human transmission have been confirmed, while the Wuhan cases are thought to have been caused through exposure to animals linked to a live seafood and animal market. Of note, no healthcare workers have fallen ill with the mystery virus.\\nRemember, the problem isn’t just that this virus is happening, it’s that it’s happening now, just before millions of Chinese travel to see family and friends during the Chinese New Year holiday.',\n",

In total, 41 people have been diagnosed with the pathogen, which preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media earlier this week pointed to a new type of coronavirus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on its website. Two of them have been discharged from hospital and the rest are in stable condition, while 739 people deemed to have been in close contact with the patients have been cleared, it said. Advertisement The man, the first victim of the outbreak that began in December, was a regular buyer at a seafood market in the city, who had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease, the health authority said. Treatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of Jan. 9 when his heart failed. He tested positive for the virus, it added. Advertisement The commission added that no new cases had been detected since Jan. 3. The Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at the seafood market and that to date no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found. The World Health Organization said on Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe. The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January when many of China’s 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via aeroplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday. The Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests. Hong Kong’s Department of Health said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border checkpoints, including the port, airport and the city’s high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.

Coronaviruses are described by the WHO as \"a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases\".\\nProbably the best known is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , commonly known as SARS, which broke out in Asia in 2003, and spread to countries in North America , South America and Europe , before being successfully contained later that year. In a statement released on Monday, the WHO identified the patient, who was hospitalised in Thailand on January 8, as a traveller from the Chinese city of Wuhan. According to Thai authorities, the patient is recovering from the illness.\\n\"WHO reiterates that it is essential that investigations continue in China to identify the source of this outbreak and any animal reservoirs or intermediate hosts,\" it said. The new virus is believed to have originated in Wuhan , infecting dozens of people in China. On Saturday, Chinese media reported the first known death from the viral infection.\\nCoronaviruses rely on animal to human transmission. There are several known coronaviruses currently circulating in animals, that have not yet infected humans. The health commission in Wuhan has reportedly declared that there is no evidence of any spread between humans.\\nHowever, with the emergence of the Thailand case, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is planning to consult the issue with the members of the agency\\'s Emergency Committee. He could also call for a meeting of the Committee at short notice, the statement said. The WHO noted that it has been expecting cases to be reported in countries other than China , underscoring the importance of monitoring and preparedness in other nations.\\nThe work of the WHO and the Chinese authorities in containing the new coronavirus will be made more complicated by the Spring Festival, also known as the Chinese New Year, which begins on January 25, and sees hundreds of millions criss-crossing the country. The WHO has issued guidance on how to detect and treat persons infected with the new strain of the virus.\\nThe standard recommendations for halting the spread of coronaviruses include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing. Common signs of coronavirus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\\nDownload The Devdiscourse News App for Latest News.

Chinese media have reported that Bangkok, Osaka and Tokyo will be the top three destinations.\\nThe Chinese government projects 3 billion passengers will ride trains and planes across China between last Friday, when the travel rush began, and Feb. 18. Thailand, a popular travel destination visited by 10 million Chinese every year, had been stepping up monitoring at airports, screening passengers for fever and other symptoms.\\nBut the WHO has also noted that the new virus is not expected to transmit readily between people.\\n\"At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission,\" the organization said in a statement released on Sunday.\\nAs of Friday, 41 cases of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus had been reported in China.

This is from the Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul. The woman is recovering at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi province, about 12 kilometres outside of Bangkok.\\n“She is now showing few fever or respiratory symptoms, and if doctors give her a clearance she could be allowed to go home in as little as a few days. She was the first person detected with the virus outside of China and her rapid diagnosis and successful treatment show the efficiency and effectiveness of Thailand’s health services.”\\nSixteen people who shared the flight with the woman were also examined, all with negative results, although some exhibited slight flu-like symptoms.\\nSince January 3, a total of 12 passengers arriving from from Wuhan in China have showed flu-like symptoms which justified their being quarantined. Eight have so far been treated and discharged\\nThe Chinese woman was treated in an isolation ward. Her infection with the coronavirus was confirmed on Sunday. The Public Health Ministry had not found anyone else infected with the virus.\\n59 people in China have been confirmed infected with the new strain of the coronavirus, which has been linked to a sudden outbreak of pneumonia in central China that has killed one. All had attended markets selling animals and seafood in Wuhan city and were either workers or buyers. There has been no known human-to-human transmission of the virus.\\nHuanan Seafood Market, one of Wuhan’s largest meat and seafood markets has been identified as the source of the outbreak and was shut down on Jan. 1. The man who died had recently been a customer.\\nCoronaviruses are not necessarily life-threatening but have been the source of several public health crises, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed hundreds of people after an outbreak in southern China in 2002 and 2003.\\nThe Wuhan viral outbreak appears less virulent and less transmittable, according to the World Health Organisation.',\n",

Now, health workers and government officials say that two female patients from Hong Kong are also exhibiting symptoms, and that the pair had visited Wuhan just two weeks prior.\\nAs the South China Morning Post reports, health officials still don’t know exactly where this viral pneumonia came from, though they have ruled out multiple possibilities. Despite the fact that additional infections have been confirmed, it’s still believed that the virus doesn’t pass from person to person, as no medical staff or relatives of those who are infected have been diagnosed with the same illness.\\nIt’s still possible that the illness is related to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, according to Dr. Gauden Galea of the World Health Organization. “There are many potential causes of this type of illness and further laboratory tests are ongoing to determine the cause of the disease,” Galea said in a statement. “At this point, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak.”\\nIt’s important to note that no deaths have been attributed to this new, unknown pneumonia virus and that Chinese officials seem to be doing their best to isolate anyone who might be infected in order to separate them from the general population.

       " ['A mysterious pneumonia outbreak that has struck dozens of people and put China on edge is from the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), according to Chinese scientists.\\nThey\\'ve found a new coronavirus in 15 of 57 patients with the illness in the central city of Wuhan, saying it has been preliminarily identified as the pathogen for the outbreak, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday.\\nThe report said the whole genome sequence of the virus has been obtained, and a sample isolated from one of the patients showed \"typical coronavirus appearance\" under an electron microscope.\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Symptoms can range from fever and coughing to kidney failure, and in some cases lead to death.\\nSARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia and spread to 37 countries in 2002 and 2003. A coronavirus is also the culprit for deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS has since killed 851 people globally, according to the WHO.\\nBut the new coronavirus in Wuhan appears to not be as lethal as SARS. Its symptoms are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing. Eight patients had recovered and been discharged from hospital as of Wednesday, and no deaths have been reported, according to CCTV.\\nThe virus was first detected in Wuhan on December 12. Since then, a total of 59 people have been struck by the illness, with seven patients in critical condition at some stage, Chinese health authorities said on Sunday.\\nAuthorities said there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission, and no healthcare workers have been infected.\\nSome of the patients were employed at a seafood market in Wuhan. Local media reported the market also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes -- sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals.\\nAccording to the WHO, coronaviruses can infect both humans and animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic began.

       " ['Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn\\'t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word \"corona,\" meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it\\'s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome , also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu , adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n\"Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,\" Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.

The virus originated in China.\\nThe other deadly virus of the corona virus is the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). There is no specific vaccine for the virus as of 2019. The virus was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Most of the cases have occurred in Arabian peninsula. Corona Virus\\nCorona Viruses were first found in humans in1960s. the viruses cause flu and gastro intestinal problems. They have great genetic variability, meaning, they can over come barriers between different species.\\nThe virus has protrusions on its surface.

       " ['A mysterious new type of pneumonia linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, is caused by a novel coronavirus, Chinese state media reported today (January 9). The reports come a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that multiple known viruses had been ruled out as a cause of the outbreak, and that a coronavirus was the likely cause. The virus had sickened at least 59 people in China as of Sunday, and according to the Associated Press , one suspected case — a woman who fell ill after returning from China — has been identified in South Korea. Xinhua reports that the virus was identified by the Chinese Academy of Engineering\\'s Xu Jianguo based on tests of samples from 15 patients with the illness. Known coronaviruses include some that cause a cold, as well as the pathogens behind severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). \"Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China\\'s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks,\" the WHO\\'s Gauden Galea says in a statement quoted by multiple news outlets. \"If the Chinese truly have sequenced the virus and they\\'ve demonstrated that it\\'s present in other patients, [that] means there\\'s a PCR diagnostic test available. And the Chinese need to make that available to the rest of the world immediately,\" Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina, tells STAT . He explains that coronaviruses could be transmitted to people from bats, or through a different animal species that had been infected by a bat . \"I am stunned by the timeline and speed of this isolation and characterization, if it\\'s all true,\" says Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in remarks to STAT . He expressed skepticism about Chinese authorities\\' claim that the virus can\\'t be transmitted between humans, saying, \"I don\\'t know how you know that at all.\" Given the number of reported cases, he says, it\\'s not likely that animal-to-human transmission is the only way the virus can spread. David Hui, an emerging infections expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, shares a similar take with The New York Times . \"So, there are still a lot of question marks ,\" he says. \"It\\'s premature to say that there\\'s no human-to-human transmission.\" Comment: See also:',\n",

Several were stallholders at a suburban seafood market that also sold pheasants, snakes, birds, and the organs of rabbits and other animals, per the South China Morning Post .\\nThe respiratory illness has apparently spread to Hong Kong—roughly four hours away by high-speed train—where 15 patients are being treated and officials have increased airport screening for fever among passengers.\\nLittle else is known, but a Wuhan health commission says the most typical symptoms are shortness of breath, fever, and occasionally lung infection. The commission adds that \"influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases\" are off the list, per LiveScience , and World Health Organization rep says \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak.\" What makes this news?

Meanwhile, 16 Hong Kong people who recently visited Wuhan, aged 2 to 55, are believed to have been infected after developing symptoms of the little-understood virus days after their return.\\nHeadline Daily reports that 10 of the Hong Kong patients have tested positive for influenza, enterovirus, and coronavirus, while the other six are awaiting test results. All are currently in stable condition .\\nThough the exact nature of the disease is still unknown, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has been ruled out as the culprit. However, the virus shares common features of the early stages of SARS, which are characterized by common flu symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and headaches.\\nAuthorities are encouraging people to exercise caution by frequently washing hands and wearing a face mask to prevent the potential spread of the disease.\\nAccording to RTHK, multiple cases of the pneumonia strain have been linked to the area of the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. Authorities have responded by closing the market and conducting measures to improve hygiene, and workers wearing protective clothing have collected samples around the area.\\nA senior lecturer of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong has cautioned that even if the virus is related to the wet market, it is still not appropriate to conclude that the disease cannot be transmitted from person to person.\\nChinese University of Hong Kong respiratory studies professor David Hui agreed that the suspected cases may not be directly linked with the market, but noted that early isolation of the suspected infections can help reduce the risk of new infections entering Hong Kong.\\nFor more Hong Kong coverage, check out Coconuts HK .\\n ',\n",

Since December of last year, as many as 60 people in China have fallen ill with pneumonia due to a mysterious contagion that has remained notoriously difficult to identify.Now according to lead scientist Xu Jianguo, preliminary laboratory results based on the testing of infected blood samples and throat swabs indicate that a new coronavirus may be to blame.It\\'s a possibility also backed up by the World Health Organisation (WHO).Coronoviruses are responsible for a number of different illnesses ranging from the common cold to the flu-like SARS virus which infected 8,098 people and killed 774 back at the beginning of the century.As it happens, SARS also originated in China before spreading to dozens of other countries.As things stand however, this new virus seems to be contained in Wuhan for the time being and there is no direct evidence that it is even capable of being transmitted from human to human.According to China\\'s WHO representative Gauden Galea, more work needs to be done to \"determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented.\"In the meantime, authorities are stepping up efforts to screen travelers and to effectively disinfect trains, planes and other modes of public transport in case the virus does start to spread.So far nobody has died, however seven of those infected are said to be in a critical condition.',\n",

       " [\"AP Explains: The pathogen behind China's pneumonia outbreak by Yanan Wang, The Associated Press Posted Jan 9, 2020 1:04 am PST\\nBEIJING — Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion.

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion.

Preliminary tests indicated the illness may be caused by a new coronavirus, lead scientist Xu Jianguo told the official Xinhua news agency. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had also said a coronavirus could be to blame for the outbreak. So far, 59 cases have been reported, seven of which are considered critical. Mr Xu, who is leading efforts to identify the cause, said they had found the “new type” of coronavirus by testing infected blood samples and throat swabs collected from 15 people. The coronavirus can cause anything from the common cold to much more severe diseases. Notably, it caused an epidemic of the potentially deadly, flu-like Sars virus back in 2002-3, which killed more than 700 people around the world after originating in China. However, Gauden Galea, the WHO representative to China, said “further investigations” were required to “determine the source, modes of transmission, the extent of infection and countermeasures implemented”.

Authorities have surprisingly demonstrated a greater level of transparency regarding the outbreak then they did with Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that emerged in 2003 and spread to 37 nations including Canada. There were more than 8,000 diagnosed cases of SARS with an approximately ten percent fatality rate over the period November 2002 through July 2003. SARS and a similar condition, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are caused by coronaviruses but have different animal reservoirs.\\nPublic health researchers in China have eliminated SARS and MERS in addition to avian influenza as the cause of the current outbreak. It is however suspected that the infection may be due to a newly emerged coronavirus. Fortunately, at this stage the infective agent does not appear to be transmissible among humans but in all probability is a zoonosis. Many patients reported contact with a Wuhan market selling seafood and exotic mammals and reptiles that are consumed as food delicacies in China.\\nIt is considered essential that health authorities identify the causal agent and define the means of transmission. January 25th marks the beginning of the Lunar New Year holiday period associated with travel involving at least 25 percent of the population in China. Although, the agent responsible for the new respiratory syndrome is not apparently transmitted among humans, circulation of the virus in a dense population may result in a mutation that increases pathogenicity and infectivity.',\n",

The man was also previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease.\\nForty-one people have been diagnosed with the new illness, according to Aljazeera, and seven are in critical condition. Two people have been discharged from the hospital. No new cases have allegedly been reported since Jan. 3. The animal market was closed on Jan. 1 for cleaning and disinfection.

Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s.

Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion.

According to a statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on Friday, the 61-year-old man was hospitalized with severe pneumonia while suffering from an abdominal tumour and chronic liver disease, although the cause of death was declared to be respiratory and circulatory failure, reports Efe news. After the completion of lab tests, a total of 41 cases of this mysterious viral pneumonia have been diagnosed. Two of these patients have been discharged, another seven are in serious condition and one has died. The rest of the patients were stable and no new cases have been detected among the 739 people who have been in contact with the patients, including 419 members of the medical teams. According to the commission, no more infections have been detected over the last three days and there is no evidence that there has been any further contagion between humans. The outbreak has sparked a health panic in China since the pathogen causing it and its origin were unknown. For many, the situation was reminiscent of 2003, when SARS spread across the country and caused a total of 646 deaths (813 worldwide), according to figures from the World Health Organization. According to the WHO, between 14 and 15 per cent of SARS cases end in death, while in the case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a related disease also caused by a coronavirus, the mortality rate shoots up to 35 per cent. The symptoms described for Wuhan pneumonia so far are fever and fatigue, accompanied by dry cough and, in many cases, dyspnea (shortness of breath). The investigation suggests that the current outbreak originated at a fish and seafood market in the city which has been shut down by the authorities. –IANS',\n",

The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.The Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases, and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests.Hong Kong's Department of Health said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border check points, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died. Follow and connect with us on Twitter , Facebook , Linkedin RELATED \",\n",

What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are described by WHO as “a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases”. Probably the best known is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, commonly known as SARS, which broke out in Asia in 2003, and spread to countries in North America, South America and Europe, before being successfully contained later that year.\\nCoronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and there are several known coronaviruses currently circulating in animals, that have not yet infected humans.\\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

The 44 cases, up from the initial 27 announced Tuesday, include 11 \"severe cases,\" health authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan said in a statement. \"The vital signs of the other patients are generally stable,\" the statement said. The authorities are still in the process of identifying the cause of the infection, but \"influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases have been excluded,\" the Wuhan health commission said on Friday, without mentioning SARS, which is caused by a coronavirus. News of the mystery pneumonia outbreak earlier this week led to speculation online that it might be linked to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a highly contagious respiratory disease. Wuhan police on Wednesday said they had punished eight people for \"publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification.\" The health commission said all patients have received treatment in isolation and the city was tracking people who had come into close contact with the patients. Some of those being treated work in a seafood market in the city, and \"no obvious evidence of human to human transmission\" has been found so far, the commission said. The World Health Organization (WHO) criticised China for under-reporting the number of SARS cases following the outbreak in 2003. SARS killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong that year. The virus, which infected more than 8,000 people around the world, is expected to have originated in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, according to WHO. China sacked its then health minister Zhang Wenkang for the poor handling of the crisis in 2003, several months after the first case was reported. WHO announced that China was free of SARS in May 2004.',\n",

       " ['The number of reported cases of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, was 59 on Sunday, according to Wuhan’s Municipal Health Commission, with seven people in critical condition. The disease afflicting patients in Wuhan hasn’t been transmitted from human to human, and health-care workers have remained uninfected. Those ill in Wuhan are believed to have become sick through exposure to animals. It was probably originated from bats and spread through wild animals to humans, said a Hong Kong-based microbiologist and specialist of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, Yuen Kwok-Jung. Wuhan patients had connections with the Huanan Seafood Market. Chinese scientists investigating the mystery illness have discovered a new strain of coronavirus. More research is needed to conclude and for finding a specific treatment. China had accumulated a lot of experience about virus testing since the SARS outbreak in 2003. People could help stop the spread of the disease simply by not eating wild animals, while markets should stop selling them, Yuen said. Wearing a surgical mask, instead of a n95 mask, in public places is good enough to keep the Wuhan disease infection away, said David Hui Shu-cheong from the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.',\n",

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\\n Eight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported.

Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.',\n",

A 61-year-old man has died from pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan after an outbreak of the yet to be identified virus while seven were in critical condition, Wuhan health authorities said on Saturday. Thai authorities are stepping up monitoring at airports ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday when hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists are expected to visit. Of 12 passengers quarantined since Jan. 3, lab results show that a 61-year-old Chinese woman carried a strain of the coronavirus, the Thai Health Ministry said on Monday. The woman, who was quarantined on Wednesday, had received treatment and was well enough to return home, the ministry said. “Being able to identify a patient shows that there is efficiency in our monitoring system. We are confident that we can manage the situation,” Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters. The Chinese outbreak of pneumonia appeared to be linked to a single seafood market in Wuhan and had not so far spread beyond there, the World Health Organisation said yesterday. WHO officials in Thailand were not immediately available for comment on Monday. Thailand receives about 10 million Chinese tourists each year.

Sharing headlinesBoth Sars – which killed nearly 800 people in China almost two decades ago – and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( Mers ) are also caused by coronaviruses, although Chinese health authorities have said neither are behind the Wuhan outbreak . The WHO said ”a novel coronavirus could not be ruled out”, although it needed more comprehensive information to confirm precisely the type of pathogen involved. The United Nations health agency said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person.Fifty-nine people are being treated for the mystery strain of pneumonia, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said on Sunday. Seven were in critical condition.Most cases of the illness have been linked to a seafood market in the city in central China. The country’s Xinhua news agency said preliminary lab results conducted by a team of experts showed a new type of coronavirus is behind the outbreak, the first cases of which were reported in December. “It may take years for researchers to develop medicines and vaccines,” the agency said. The WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically, including in 2002 to cause Sars and in 2012 to cause Mers.Over 8,000 fell ill from Sars in China during that outbreak, which was initially covered up by authorities before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic.

The new discovery comes in the wake of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003 and the first human detection of MERS -CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2012.\\nA WSJ source said the novel strain has been genetically sequenced from one patient sample and was found in some of the others, but it hasn’t been confirmed as the underlying cause in all of the 59 outbreak cases.\\nSix Coronaviruses Tied to Human Cases Tim Sheahan, Ph.D., a coronavirus expert who is an assistant professor in the department of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health, said there are six coronavirus known to infect humans. Four of them typically cause common cold symptoms. The other two— SARS and MERS -CoV—have been linked to sometimes fatal illnesses.\\nCIDRAP reports that as is the case with SARS and MERS -CoV, the newly detected coronavirus probably has a zoonotic source, he said, noting that intensive epidemiological investigations are likely under way in China to trace the virus reservoir.\\nThe seafood market at the center of the investigation also sold live animals such as poultry, bats, marmots, and snakes. In the SARS outbreak, bats harbored the virus, which passed it to palm civets as the intermediate host, which then transmitted the virus to people in the live-market setting.\\nBefore SARS emerged, coronaviruses were typically known as nuisance viruses in agriculture and pets, but over the last two decades they have become game changers, given that some of the newly identified ones can cause severe disease, Sheahan said.\\nQuestions Persist about Patient Profile Virologists say what’s known so far about the patients’ clinical picture fits with coronavirus infection, but they want to know more about the profiles of patients who are getting sick, such as their ages and if they have underlying health conditions.\",\n",

       " [\"AP Explains: The pathogen behind China's pneumonia outbreak by Yanan Wang, Posted Jan 9, 2020 4:04 am EST\\nBEIJING — Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\\n___\\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\\nYanan Wang, Join the conversation\",\n",

The infected patients have been quarantined along with 121 people who had been in close contact with them, the statement read. An investigation of experts from the central Chinese National Health Commission has found that the outbreak in Wuhan could have begun in the seafood market. At the same time, the nature of the viral outbreak remains unknown. The investigators have so far ruled out common flu, avian flu, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases. The infected individuals reportedly display symptoms typical of pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. It prompted fears on the Internet that the nation might be experiencing a return of the SARS, an epidemic that had claimed more than 600 lives in China throughout 2002-2003. The Wuhan authorities confirmed the outbreak on 31 December, saying that 27 people have tested positive since the beginning of that month. According to the World Health Organisation, SARS is a disease of unknown aetiology with an incubation period of up to 10 days with an estimated fatality rate of 3 percent.

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003. A preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\\n___\\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\\nYanan Wang, The Associated Press\",\n",

Eleven of them were in a serious condition, while a further 121 people who had been in close contact with the infected patients had been placed under medical observation. No deaths have been reported. Wuhan - Municipal - Health - Commission - Origin Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said that the origin of the viral pneumonia outbreak remained unknown.

Currently, there are 59 known cases of this pneumonia-like illness. And while Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has been ruled out as a cause, public health officials are concerned about another potential pandemic.The outbreak came to light in late December and prompted fears in China of a possible resurgence of SARS, an acute viral respiratory illness first reported in the country in 2002 that caused a pandemic that ripped through Asia.

An outbreak of pneumonia that has killed one person in China and infected 40 others appears to be linked to a single seafood market in the central city of Wuhan and has not so far spread beyond there, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday. The cluster of infections had raised fears of a potential epidemic after China said last week that the virus causing it was a previously unknown type but came from the same family of viruses that caused the SARS and Mers epidemics. However, the WHO said the outbreak had not spread. The seafood market in Wuhan – a major domestic and international transport hub – is now closed and no cases have been reported elsewhere in China or internationally, it said. “The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan,” the WHO statement said, adding that the market was closed on January 1. “At this stage, there is no infection among health care workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission.” The WHO said last week that a newly emerging member of the ‘coronavirus’ family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) outbreaks was the likely cause of the outbreak. Coronaviruses can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some types cause less serious disease, while others can be far more severe.

The authorities added they are confident they can control the situation. According to the report, 16 people who were sitting near the patient on the same flight were examined,... and their results all came up negative. It's the first time the virus has been confirmed outside China, UN and Thai officials said on Monday. The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. The UN health agency (WHO) confirmed that the outbreak in the city of Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of corona virus, a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS. Authorities in Wuhan said a seafood market in the city was the center of the outbreak. It was closed on 1 January. There is so far no indication of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Scientists in Hong Kong's Department of Health said on Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus from a Wuhan patient, published online by a Chinese expert, indicated it was 80 percent similar to SARS found in bats.

(Hong Kong Government Information Service via AP) View 3 more images (Newser) – A mystery illness that is striking China isn\\'t SARS—but it\\'s dredging up memories and fears of the deadly outbreak that began in 2002 and killed 800-plus people. As of Sunday , at least 59 people have come down with a pneumonia-like illness in the city of Wuhan and are being treated in isolation. What\\'s causing it isn\\'t known—so far MERS, bird flu, and the adenovirus have also been struck from the list of possibilities—but the symptoms align: a high fever, breathing issues, and lung lesions. The one connection that has emerged is a local seafood market where some of the patients had worked, reports the AP . STAT News reports the market was thought to also sell \"exotic animals\" as food; the market was shut down so it could be disinfected and investigated.\\nThe New York Times notes the virus that caused SARS originated in a market—from infected civet cats sold as a delicacy, though the true root of the outbreak was likely bats; experts posit that contact with infected animals is again a likely cause of this illness. One positive note from an American coronavirus (that\\'s the family of viruses behind SARS) expert: \"It\\'s occurring in the right spot,\" he tells STAT of the mystery disease, noting that Wuhan \"is the epicenter for a lot of virology research in China\" and home to labs where the world\\'s deadliest pathogens are studied.

       " [\"A strange pneumonia-like infection that first popped up in the Chinese city of Wuhan just days ago is beginning to spread, with the total number of infected individuals climbing from 27 to at least 44. Another 121 people are under medical supervision as doctors try to confirm whether or not they have the same illness.\\nThe sickness, which is being compared to bird flu and SARS, appears to have originated in or near the Huanan seafood market, and some of the original infections were traced to workers who operate stalls there. Now, health workers and government officials say that two female patients from Hong Kong are also exhibiting symptoms, and that the pair had visited Wuhan just two weeks prior.\\nAs the South China Morning Post reports, health officials still don’t know exactly where this viral pneumonia came from, though they have ruled out multiple possibilities. Despite the fact that additional infections have been confirmed, it’s still believed that the virus doesn’t pass from person to person, as no medical staff or relatives of those who are infected have been diagnosed with the same illness.\\nIt’s still possible that the illness is related to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, according to Dr. Gauden Galea of the World Health Organization. “There are many potential causes of this type of illness and further laboratory tests are ongoing to determine the cause of the disease,” Galea said in a statement. “At this point, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak.”\\nIt’s important to note that no deaths have been attributed to this new, unknown pneumonia virus and that Chinese officials seem to be doing their best to isolate anyone who might be infected in order to separate them from the general population.

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\\n___\\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\\nYanan Wang, The Associated Press ON AIR RIGHT NOW\",\n",

       " ['Tweet Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a complex viral agent that causes a variety of clinical manifestations in cats, commonly known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). It is recognized that FCoV can occur in two different serotypes. However, differences in the S protein are much more than serological or antigenic variants, resulting in the effective presence of two distinct viruses. Here, we review the distinct differences in the S proteins of these viruses, which are likely to translate into distinct biological outcomes. We introduce a new concept related to the non-taxonomical classification and differentiation among FCoVs by analyzing and comparing the genetic, structural, and functional characteristics of FCoV and the FCoV S protein among the two serotypes and FCoV biotypes. Based on our analysis, we suggest that our understanding of FIP needs to consider whether the presence of these two distinct viruses has implications in clinical settings.',\n",

Two of these patients have been discharged, another seven are in serious condition and one has died.The rest of the patients were stable and no new cases have been detected among the 739 people who have been in contact with the patients, including 419 members of the medical teams.According to the commission, no more infections have been detected over the last three days and there is no evidence that there has been any further contagion between humans.The outbreak has sparked a health panic in China since the pathogen causing it and its origin were unknown. For many, the situation was reminiscent of 2003, when SARS spread across the country and caused a total of 646 deaths (813 worldwide), according to figures from the World Health Organization.According to the WHO, between 14 and 15 per cent of SARS cases end in death, while in the case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a related disease also caused by a coronavirus, the mortality rate shoots up to 35 per cent.The symptoms described for Wuhan pneumonia so far are fever and fatigue, accompanied by dry cough and, in many cases, dyspnea (shortness of breath).The investigation suggests that the current outbreak originated at a fish and seafood market in the city which has been shut down by the authorities.

       " [\"A 61-year-old man has died from pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan after an outbreak of a yet to be identified virus, while seven others are in critical condition, the Wuhan health authorities said on Saturday. In total, 41 people have been diagnosed with the pathogen, which preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media earlier this week pointed to a new type of coronavirus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on its website. Two of those diagnosed have been discharged from hospital and the rest are in stable condition, while 739 people deemed to have been in close contact with the patients have been cleared, it said. The man, the first victim of the outbreak that began in December, a regular buyer at a seafood market in the city, had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease, the health authority said. Treatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of Jan. 9 when his heart failed. He tested positive for the virus, the authority added. The commission added that no new cases had been detected since January 3. The Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at the seafood market, and that to date no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found. The World Health Organization said on Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS are far more severe. The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be traveling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday. In its statement, the authority also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases, and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen– and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests. Hong Kong's Department of Health said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border check points, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city. In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.\",\n",

To date, over 42 million doses of these low-cost OCVs have been deployed worldwide.\\n\"IVI\\'s contribution to global health is invaluable considering both the technical support provided to low- and middle-income countries and the focus on diseases disproportionally affecting people living in poverty,\" said Dr Teresa Soop, Senior research advisor at Sida.\\nIn addition to funding for IVI operations, Sida has previously granted additional project funding for IVI\\'s priority disease areas: cholera, dengue, and typhoid. These funds have supported a range of epidemiology and vaccine programs, including generating evidence on disease burden across developing Asian and African countries; accelerating the development and introduction of affordable dengue, oral cholera, and typhoid vaccines across Asia and South America; and increasing the capacity of developing countries to implement immunization programs in Central Asia.\\nSida\\'s contribution to IVI extends beyond providing core funding and governance, to impacting operations and culture, particularly in the areas of sustainability and gender equality. With Sida\\'s guidance, IVI initiated an Environmental Impact Assessment in 2018 which resulted in the formation of an internal Environmental Management System committee to oversee IVI\\'s environmental impacts and champion sustainable development. IVI has also initiated efforts to further cultivate diversity and inclusion in personnel policies and leadership. These are two examples of how IVI benefits from and reciprocates partnership with its member states. ###\\nAbout the International Vaccine Institute (IVI)\\nThe International Vaccine Institute (IVI) is a nonprofit inter-governmental organization established in 1997 at the initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, IVI was the first international organization hosted by Korea. IVI has 35 signatory countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) on its treaty, including Korea, Sweden and India as state funders. Our mandate is to make vaccines available and accessible for the world\\'s most vulnerable people. We focus on infectious diseases of global health importance such as cholera, typhoid, shigella, salmonella, schistosomiasis, Group A Strep, Hepatitis A, HPV, TB, HIV, MERS-Corona Virus, as well as antimicrobial resistance.

All 59 patients have been quarantined. The commission has also said that it has traced around 163 people who had close contact with the patients and will continue tracing other contacts.\\nOn Monday, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection confirmed that a total of 21 cases related to respiratory-type infections had been reported in the city over the past week. Seven of those infected have recovered. Most of the cases appear to be influenza and other respiratory-related diseases, and only five cases appear to be connected to an unknown disease. However, none of those cases appear to be connected to the virus outbreak in Wuhan.\\nThe Wuhan outbreak is believed to have begun some time between December 12 and December 29. Some of those infected worked at the same seafood market, which has since been shut down for decontamination. Symptoms patients have experienced include fever and difficulty breathing. Chest radiographs of those infected show invasive lesions on their lungs.\\nWhile Hong Kong officials said the outbreak may be the result of a similar virus, Chinese officials confirmed Sunday that the Wuhan pneumonia cases are not due to the virus that causes SARS.\\nHo Pak Leung, director of the University of Hong Kong's Center for Infection, noted this week that there has not yet been any evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. However, he said that if the virus does end up being transmitted through humans, it would be difficult to prevent virus carriers from visiting Hong Kong due to the high volume of people constantly traveling between the city and the mainland.\\nAccording to David Hui Shu Cheong, chairman of the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, it might take a few weeks for health officials to determine the DNA sequence of the virus, Asia Times reported.\\nAccording to the Asia Times, the Ruttonjee Hospital in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district on Saturday admitted a female patient from mainland China who was suffering from a cough and a fever after traveling the city from Wuhan. The woman was permitted to leave the hospital on Sunday evening. It is unclear if she had contracted the unknown viral infection.\\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), SARS is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, which is a type of virus that affects the respiratory tract of mammals. SARS was first reported in Asia back in 2003. It spread to 37 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774 in 2003, the same year that the virus was contained.

Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.\\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be traveling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.\\nThe Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases, and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests.\\nHong Kong's Department of Health said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border check points, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.\\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.\\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh; Additional reporting by Sophie Yu in Beijing and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Editing by Sandra Maler and Jacqueline Wong) Top Stories \",\n",

The last thing it needs is another quintessentially east-asian public health crisis.\\nHeadlines about a new pneumonia-like illness spreading through China have appeared in the Western press over the past week . Officials in the region, including in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have been fearful of the virus’s spread since Beijing delivered a notice warning about the virus on Dec. 31, when just 27 people were infected. As of Thursday, a little more than a week later, the number had risen to 59 – with seven in critical condition.\\nNow, it appears public health officials worst fears have been confirmed: Preliminary tests indicate the mysterious illness may be caused by a new coronavirus, according to lead scientist Xu Jianguo, who delivered the news to China’s official Xinhua news agency, according to the BBC.\\nXu said he and his researchers found the “new type” of coronavirus by testing infected blood samples and throat swabs collected from 15 people.\\nCrucially, coronaviruses can be the cause of a wide range of illnesses, from common colds, to infections like the SARS virus that originated in China in 2002 and 2003 and ended up killing 700 people around the world.\\nCourtesy of the BBC\\nBeijing’s confirmation seems to affirm the WHO’s suspicion that a coronavirus could be to blame for the outbreak.\\nWhile identifying the virus type is a start for authorities, “further investigations” are still necessary, said Gauden Galea, The WHO representative for China. For example, pathology investigators still need to understand how the virus spreads.\\nSo far, zero cases of human to human transmission have been confirmed, while the Wuhan cases are thought to have been caused through exposure to animals linked to a live seafood and animal market. Of note, no healthcare workers have fallen ill with the mystery virus.\\nRemember, the problem isn’t just that this virus is happening, it’s that it’s happening now, just before millions of Chinese travel to see family and friends during the Chinese New Year holiday.',\n",

       " ['Since mid-December, a mystery illness has gripped the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in the same region where a deadly viral epidemic emerged nearly 20 years ago. So far, one person has died and dozens of others have been hospitalized with unexplained pneumonia-like symptoms, including high fever, lung lesions, and difficulty breathing. While initial reports were limited, government officials announced Thursday that a task force of Chinese researchers has identified the microbe causing the outbreak. The culprit, they say, is a virus never seen before in humans; a newly discovered member of the coronavirus family, other branches of which cause the common cold, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).Reports from state media last week indicated that the Chinese-led research team already has copies of the virus growing in cell lines. Under pressure from the global public health community to release more details, the consortium published a draft genome of the novel coronavirus over the weekend, encouraging researchers around the world to analyze and share the data. The development is an important one for containment efforts. That information will enable hospitals to more effectively test for new cases, and can provide some guidance for potential treatments. Some scientists in the US have already determined that the as-yet-unnamed new virus appears to be most closely genetically related to its more contagious SARS-causing cousins. But so far, there is no evidence that it can spread as easily between humans. Scientists - Health - Officials - West - Situation To some scientists and public health officials in the West, the evolving situation in Wuhan has an upside: It demonstrates that China’s scientific infrastructure and public health policies have made huge strides since the 2003 SARS outbreak. That disease eventually spread to 26 countries, killing 774 people and sickening thousands more. But for the first few months of that outbreak,... (Excerpt) Read more at: Wired',\n",

The cluster of infections had raised fears of a potential epidemic after China said last week that the virus causing it was a previously unknown type but came from the same family of viruses that caused the SARS and MERS epidemics.\\nHowever, the WHO said the outbreak had not spread. The seafood market in Wuhan - a major domestic and international transport hub - is now closed and no cases have been reported elsewhere in China or internationally, it said.\\n“The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan,” the WHO statement said, adding that the market was closed on Jan. 1. “At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission.”\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a separate statement late on Sunday that 4 additional patients have been released and that no new cases have been discovered as of Saturday.\\nAnother 717 people deemed to be in close contact with the patients remain under medical observation, the authority said.\\nThe WHO said last week that a newly emerging member of the ’coronavirus’ family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks was the likely cause of the outbreak.\\nCoronaviruses can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some types cause less serious disease, while others can be far more severe.\\nAmong 41 people confirmed as infected with the new viral pneumonia, one - a 61-year-old man with serious underlying medical conditions - died last week. Seven others are in critical condition, the Wuhan health authorities said.\\nThe WHO said preliminary epidemiological investigations had found most cases were in people who either worked at or were frequent visitors to Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\\n“To date, investigations are still under way to assess the full extent of the outbreak,” it added.\\nRelated Man infected with mysterious virus in China dies as outbreak continues Pneumonia outbreak in China may be linked to new virus from SARS, MERS family: WHO',\n",

Another 121 people are under medical supervision as doctors try to confirm whether or not they have the same illness.\\nThe sickness, which is being compared to bird flu and SARS, appears to have originated in or near the Huanan seafood market, and some of the original infections were traced to workers who operate stalls there. Now, health workers and government officials say that two female patients from Hong Kong are also exhibiting symptoms, and that the pair had visited Wuhan just two weeks prior.\\nAs the South China Morning Post reports, health officials still don’t know exactly where this viral pneumonia came from, though they have ruled out multiple possibilities. Despite the fact that additional infections have been confirmed, it’s still believed that the virus doesn’t pass from person to person, as no medical staff or relatives of those who are infected have been diagnosed with the same illness.\\nIt’s still possible that the illness is related to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, according to Dr. Gauden Galea of the World Health Organization. “There are many potential causes of this type of illness and further laboratory tests are ongoing to determine the cause of the disease,” Galea said in a statement. “At this point, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak.”\\nIt’s important to note that no deaths have been attributed to this new, unknown pneumonia virus and that Chinese officials seem to be doing their best to isolate anyone who might be infected in order to separate them from the general population.

Experts indentified the new virus on Tuesday and have obtained its genome sequence, the China Central Television (CCTV) reported Thursday. They will continue studying the virus\\' etiology, epidemiology and clinical features, the report said.Experts noted that the virus\\' genome and nucleic acid does not take long to be identified, but requires weeks to separate the virus and identify its pathogenicity and years to develop medicine and vaccine against it.Liu Youning, a professor of epidemiology and respiratory medicine at the Chinese PLA General Hospital, told the Global Times on Thursday that the coronavirus found in Wuhan appears to be far less serious than the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Liu said it is urgent to discover how the virus is transmitted as China\\'s Spring Festival travel rush approaches.\"A next step is to determine its exact mode of transmission,\" but so far, there is no clear sign of human-to-human transmission as the Wuhan health authority had announced.\"This could be due to good protective measures, or that the disease itself is not contagious,\" Liu said. This year\\'s Spring Festival travel rush begins on Friday. A total of 3 billion trips are estimated to be made during the 40-day rush, reports said.Precautionary measures in populated areas will be enhanced to prevent the spread of the virus during the period, officials said.Eight of the hospitalized patients previously diagnosed with pneumonia caused by the new virus in Wuhan have been discharged, media reported on Wednesday. Local governments would return treatment expenses to these patients, Chinese financial news outlet Caixin reported on Thursday, citing the patients\\' families. Meanwhile, 48 suspicious cases of pneumonia have been found in Hong Kong and one in South Korea as of Thursday. Twenty-one of the suspicious patients in Hong Kong have been discharged, according to the local hospital authority. Coronaviruses usually impact the respiratory system and intestines. The virus\\' surface looks like a crown and has many orderly small bulges on its surface. They can transmit among humans and some animals like pigs, birds and rats. Six coronaviruses are known to infect people, including the virus that causes SARS and MERS, reports said. China has set up systems to prevent epidemics based on a wealth of experiences in dealing with SARS in 2003.A total of 8,437 SARS cases were reported all around the world from November 1, 2002 to July 11, 2003, with 813 of the patients dead, the World Health Organization (WHO) website said. No new case of SARS has been reported since 2004, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

[19659003] Photo : Getty Images Scientists in China believe they have taken a break from a mysterious illness that caused pneumonia in dozens of people . A virus was discovered in several patients that had never been discovered before – although one is related to the viruses responsible for SARS and other respiratory diseases. On Thursday, the state news agency Xinhua reported the results of a preliminary investigation into the outbreak that has so far made 59 people ill and left seven in serious condition. In 15 people scientists stated that they had identified a strong suspicion of the disease: a previously unknown type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a family of spiky, spherical viruses that are known to infect a variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Most corona viruses that make people sick cause nothing more than a typical cold. However, in the past few decades, we have come across two more dangerous and sometimes fatal viruses – the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS and the one that causes respiratory syndrome in the Middle East or MERS. This week, the Chinese government declared that the mysterious illness was not a SARS after its residents spent weeks on social media accusing it of hiding the truth about an SARS outbreak within its confines. According to the Chinese government, no victims have been tested positive for other likely perpetrators, such as avian flu, while the genetics of the mystery virus have been fully sequenced, precluding the possibility that they are SARS, MERS, or another known corona virus. At this point, the work of the research team has yet to be independently confirmed. However, on Wednesday the World Health Organization was confident early on that the mysterious disease could be caused by a coronavirus. Infections seen, including SARS and MERS, tend to be zoonotic, meaning that they were initially transmitted from animals to humans (SARS was likely to be rodents or bats; MERS was camels). This also appears to be the case for this new corona virus. In most cases, people worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, where many live animals are kept. Sometimes these new viruses can easily spread from person to person or can quickly mutate into an infectious strain. At least at the moment, this is not the case since no cases of person-to-person transmission have been reported. It also does not appear to be as fatal as SARS or MERS since no patients died . However, there are still many questions about the virus that need to be answered even where it first appeared.',\n",

Those cases are marked by fever, difficulty breathing and invasive lesions on the lungs and are revealed through chest X-rays. Seven of the cases are considered to be critical.A number of those infected worked at a large seafood market, which sells live animals and which has since been closed to sanitize the space and investigate the outbreak.

Ganabaskaran said GPs were the most available and easiest outlet for the public to obtain such vaccinations but were typically supplied after public and private hospitals.\\nThis was exacerbated by the shortage of the influenza vaccine from the four major suppliers that has left many GPs without any stock of the vaccine, he added.\\n“Many GPs have called MMA to report this problem. Talk on this is also currently trending on various social media platforms with GPs voicing their displeasure about the supply problem with allegations that importance is given to the private hospitals while the fragmented but well distributed GP clinics are being sidelined.\\n“Each time when there is a vaccine shortage, the GPs are the last to receive supply if there are any stocks. Normally, priority is given to the public hospitals, followed by private hospitals and the leftovers to the 7,000 well distributed general practitioners that have faster and more convenient access for the rakyat,” said Dr Ganabaskaran in a statement.\\n“The GPs being the first point of contact and who are close to the community should be given priority by the suppliers but in reality, this is not happening.”\\nAccording to Dr Ganabaskaran, GP visits stand at 70 million annually, with almost 80 per cent of their patients being repeat visitors or regulars.\\nHe hoped that the suppliers would be more prepared for sudden outbreaks of vaccinable diseases and to consider patients’ convenience and welfare over other factors.\\n“MMA hopes the suppliers will play a proactive role whenever there is an increase of certain illnesses that can be prevented by primary care practitioners.\\n“The needs of patients must come first. Convenience in access to healthcare will increase efficiency and ultimately, the standard of healthcare delivery in the country,” the statement continued.\\nYesterday the Penang State Health Department recorded 10 clusters of Influenza-like Illness involving 62 individuals with influenza in the clusters from December 29 until noon.\\nEarlier this month, an outbreak of “viral pneumonia of unknown origin” attributed to influenza was traced to the Wuhan province in China.\\nThe outbreak is creating fear across Asia, which saw over 700 deaths due to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, in the region in the early 2000s.\\nForty-four cases of the latest mystery pneumonia were reported in the Chinese province alone and similar viral respiratory illnesses have been detected in Hong Kong.\\nCloser to home, Singapore reported its first case last week after an incoming traveller from China fell sick.\\nMalaysia has not reported any case so far but has tightened up health screenings at all international borders as a precaution.

Scientist Xu Jianguo, who led an investigation into the disease, claims the outbreak is due to a new version of the virus that is different from the viruses behind MERS and SARS. Both are serious and often fatal conditions.\\nCoronavirus is a common type of virus. Most often, it is responsible for mild colds on the sinuses and nose. Although the majority of coronaviruses are not serious, there are selected examples, including the type that causes severe acute respiratory disease (SARS).\\nAccording to Xinhua Net, a total of 59 cases of coronavirus-related pneumonia were reported on late Sunday, January 5. According to Chinese health authorities, seven of these 59 cases are in \"serious condition\" and a further eight former patients were cured of the disease before being sent home from the hospital.\\nThe World Health Organization released a notice of the outbreak on Thursday. gene sequencing is said to have been used to determine the uniqueness of this virus and praised the speed with which nationwide health officials were able to isolate and identify the cause of the outbreak. Chinese authorities have ruled out other possible causes of pneumonia, including avian flu and SARS.\\nAlthough the novel corona virus isolated from this outbreak is classified as potentially serious, Chinese officials say it cannot be easily passed from person to person, which means that it is not very contagious. The WHO expects additional information about the condition and the virus to be available in the coming weeks to provide information about the extent of the transmission.',\n",

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n\"Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,\" Galea said in a statement, adding that it \"demonstrates China\\'s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.\"\\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travellers to Wuhan.\\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong\\'s Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan\\'s health commission said.\\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\\nOn Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently travelled to Wuhan.\\nThe CDC this week also advised US travellers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.

All 59 patients have been quarantined. The commission has also said that it has traced around 163 people who had close contact with the patients and will continue tracing other contacts. On Monday, Hong Kong’s Center for Health Protection confirmed that a total of 21 cases related to respiratory-type infections had been reported in the city over the past week. Seven of those infected have recovered. Most of the cases appear to be influenza and other respiratory-related diseases, and only five cases appear to be connected to an unknown disease. However, none of those cases appear to be connected to the virus outbreak in Wuhan.\\nThe Wuhan outbreak is believed to have begun some time between December 12 and December 29. Some of those infected worked at the same seafood market, which has since been shut down for decontamination. Symptoms patients have experienced include fever and difficulty breathing. Chest radiographs of those infected show invasive lesions on their lungs. While Hong Kong officials said the outbreak may be the result of a similar virus, Chinese officials confirmed Sunday that the Wuhan pneumonia cases are not due to the virus that causes SARS.\\nHo Pak Leung, director of the University of Hong Kong’s Center for Infection, noted this week that there has not yet been any evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. However, he said that if the virus does end up being transmitted through humans, it would be difficult to prevent virus carriers from visiting Hong Kong due to the high volume of people constantly traveling between the city and the mainland.\\nAccording to David Hui Shu Cheong, chairman of the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, it might take a few weeks for health officials to determine the DNA sequence of the virus, Asia Times reported. According to the Asia Times, the Ruttonjee Hospital in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district on Saturday admitted a female patient from mainland China who was suffering from a cough and a fever after traveling the city from Wuhan.

Zhang Wanqing 2020-01-09 08:44:39\\nA new type of coronavirus is believed to be the cause of a mysterious pneumonia that has infected dozens of people in both the central Chinese city of Wuhan and Hong Kong, state broadcaster CCTV reported Thursday, citing the results of a preliminary investigation by a team of experts from the National Health Commission.\\nThe Hubei Provincial Health Commission appeared to endorse this finding by sharing CCTV’s report on its official account on social app WeChat — though a staff member at the commission who answered Sixth Tone’s phone call Thursday would not comment on the nature of the virus.\\nXu Jianguo, the director of China’s National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention and the leader of the team of experts, told Xinhua News Agency that his team had sequenced the virus’ entire genome on Tuesday. “A total of 15 positive results for a new coronavirus were obtained from patients,” he added.\\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are six known coronaviruses that infect humans. Four produce relatively minor flu-like symptoms, while two — the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory system (MERS) — are more serious. Wuhan health authorities on Sunday ruled out the possibility that SARS and MERS were responsible for city’s infections.\\nThough coronaviruses typically infect mammals — including bats, livestock, and household pets — they can also infect humans, and may spread from sick to healthy people through the air (coughing and sneezing), close physical contact, or when fingers touch a contaminated surface and then the mouth, nose, or eyes, according to the U.S. CDC. Chinese authorities, however, say they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the Wuhan cases.\\nThe World Health Organization has confirmed that a new coronavirus may be responsible for the outbreak cluster in Wuhan, according to multiple media reports Thursday.\\n“For the next step, we will need to conduct further research and examinations based on etiological research, epidemiological investigation, and clinical symptoms,” Xu said.\\nSince the first symptoms of the mysterious illness were observed on Dec. 12, over 50 people in Wuhan have been infected — eight of whom recovered and were discharged from local hospitals Wednesday, according to CCTV. Beyond the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has reported 38 pneumonia-like infections in people who recently traveled to Wuhan, as well as one case each in Singapore and South Korea , though the former was later dismissed as unrelated to the Wuhan cluster.\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not published any updates since Jan. 5, unnerving Hong Kong’s health authorities as they grapple with the city’s own mystery infections.\\nDespite dozens of cases in Hong Kong, not a single unexplained illness has been reported in another mainland city in recent weeks. “This Wuhan disease is so weird — it only seems to affect Hong Kong people,” quipped one user on microblogging platform Weibo.\\nEditor: David Paulk.',\n",

These include well-known pathogens like those responsible for SARS and MERS.\\nHowever, Huang said that animals are the usual hosts of these viruses. She said it is therefore possible that the virus behind this outbreak is either new to science or a virus that has not been known to affect humans before.\\nHuang said it is likely that the virus was first transmitted from animals to people, and has only a limited ability to spread between people. She said the virus is likely to spread through coughing and sneezing.

Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\\n___\\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\\n \",\n",

If so, in what direction? Second question, regarding the DNA sequence of the virus, is that really nothing that the Government can do rather than wait for the Mainland authorities? Can't Hong Kong authorities head to Wuhan to do something? Secretary for Food and Health: I think the Government has always been active and proactive in getting information. We have an existing mechanism of communication. Regarding this communication, the Government has always been proactive in trying to get information and having communication with the Mainland authorities. In terms of getting the genome sequence, we have already requested and we are waiting for the reply of the Mainland authorities. An important point to note is that according to our infection control experts, right now with our laboratory competence, actually we can also test given the information of the novel corona virus but it takes slightly longer time. If we can get the whole genome sequence, obviously the time can be cut short. So, it is not something we can't do but we are, at the same time, trying to get information in terms of preparing and also controlling any public health issues in relation to infectious disease. Reporter: Regarding the new death case, does Hong Kong Government see the need to enhance measures? Secretary for Food and Health: First of all, we got some new information from the Mainland authorities this morning regarding the number of cases. As you can see from the information provided, actually the number of confirmed cases is now down to 41 given the novel corona virus confirmation. Secondly, according to the information, the Wuhan authority and the health department are doing a lot of work currently in terms of trying to get more epidemiological information, public health surveillance as well as treating the cases in the hospital. Of note is that there are still some serious cases, but there are also some that have already been discharged from hospital. According to the Mainland authorities, there is no evidence of human to human transmission and there is also no healthcare professional being infected. These are the information that we have collected so far. And also of note is after the closure of the concerned market in Wuhan, there is no new case since January 3. I think these are important epidemiological information for us to do further assessment. I will be chairing a meeting later on. We are also trying to invite experts. And also I will be receiving reports from the Centre for Health Protection and the Hospital Authority about the latest assessment and whether there is any latest information.

Forty-one people with pneumonia-like symptoms have so far been diagnosed with the new type of coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where it was first confirmed, with one of the victims dying, the city’s health commission said on its website. Seven others remained in serious condition while two were discharged from treatment, it added, saying the latest tally was completed on Friday. The commission did not specify when the death occurred or give further details on the patient other than to say the bulk of those diagnosed worked at a Wuhan seafood market that was closed January 1 following the outbreak. The episode has caused alarm due to the link to SARS, or Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. READ ALSO: Iran Accepts Shooting Down Ukraine Passenger Plane ‘Unintentionally’ State-run Xinhua news agency reported on Friday that Chinese scientists investigating the outbreak had made a “preliminary” determination that it was a previously unknown type of coronavirus. The WHO says coronaviruses are a large family of pathogens ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012 and also caused scores of deaths. “No new cases have been detected since January 3, 2020,” the Wuhan health commission said. “At present, no infections among medical staff have been found, and no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.” Wuhan authorities had earlier said 59 people had fallen ill, but Saturday’s statement suggests that not all have been confirmed as cases of the new virus. The outbreak was first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, which has a population of more than 11 million. Authorities in Hong Kong have since taken precautions including stepping up the disinfection of trains and planes, and checks of passengers. The WHO, however, said Thursday it was not recommending any specific measures for travellers, nor the application of any trade or travel restrictions on China based on current information, expressing confidence in the ability of Chinese authorities to manage the situation. China has since ruled out a fresh recurrence of SARS. Travel Rush Looms China has entered its annual Lunar New Year holiday travel rush, raising the spectre of the mass movement of people serving as a vector for the pathogen’s spread. In the world’s largest annual human migration, hundreds of millions of people are expected to pack together on trains, buses and planes for the Lunar New Year holiday that this year falls in late January. Authorities have said 400 million train tickets have been purchased for holiday-related travel, with hundreds of millions more expected to travel by air and road. China has not announced any travel restrictions. Authorities in Hong Kong have said 48 people have been hospitalised in recent days after returning from Wuhan and displaying flu-like illnesses, but none were confirmed to have contracted the new coronavirus. City residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week. The coming holiday has prompted concerns in Taiwan, where officials urged the island’s health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls at airports. The US embassy in China warned on Tuesday that Americans travelling in the country should avoid animals and contact with sick people. AFP',\n",

The statement was made amid an outbreak of a new type of coronavirus in the mainland city of Wuhan this month, which has local authorities adopting precautionary measures to prevent its spread to Macau. Despite their purpose as an effective disease prevention apparatus, masks are not needed in all cases, the SSM said. Wearing a mask is recommended when visiting medical facilities or institutions and in circumstances where the mask-wearer has respiratory symptoms, or a fever. Otherwise, wearing a mask is not essential. The health authority also reminded the public to maintain good hygiene by washing their hands, keeping indoor areas well-ventilated and refraining from touching their eyes, noses and mouths when in contact with other people. The statement comes after the SSM sought to dispel rumors suggesting that there was a shortage of masks in some local pharmacies. The health supervisor confirmed the availability of masks at the vast majority of the city’s 294 pharmacies. It also stressed that the supply of masks should be sufficient for the city’s population.

Authorities found that a dozen of the travelers had developed flu-like symptoms while the woman was the only one diagnosed with coronavirus, he said.\\n\"One of them had a high temperature, according to a scanner at Suvarnabhumi Airport, and was quarantined at the Bamrasnaradura Institute on Jan. 8,\" Anutin said. \"The lab results showed it is the first case of the new strain of coronavirus found in Thailand and the first found outside of China.\"\\n\"She was treated and is ready to travel back to her country. We found no more patients suffering from coronavirus,\" Anutin said, adding the others suffered from seasonal flu and eight had been treated and released.\\nAnutin urged the public to not panic because the patient, identified as a 61-year-old woman, was being quarantined until she returned to China.\\nSeveral dozen people in Wuhan have suffered from coronavirus and one man has died, according to news reports. A meat and seafood market in the city has been closed after it was linked to the outbreak.\\nChinese officials said they had not identified the cause of the outbreak and played down speculation that it could be a repeat of the coronavirus blamed for the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in 2003.\\nAfter Thailand reported its first case of a person being diagnosed with the coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday it was working with Thai and Chinese officials.\\n\"The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,\" the U.N. agency said in a statement. \"WHO has issued guidance on how to detect and treat persons who are ill with the new virus. The genetic sequencing shared by China enables more countries to rapidly diagnose patients.\"\\nEarlier this month, WHO reported that patients who have been infected suffer from fever, shortness of breath and have an accumulation of fluid in their lungs as detected by x-rays.\\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronaviruses are common in different species of animals, including camels and bats.

The advisory said \"Travellers to China should follow simple public health measures at all times. They should observe good personal hygiene, practice frequent hand washing with soap, follow respiratory etiquette, cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing. Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness, such as cough, runny nose etc. Avoid contact with live animals and consumption of raw/undercooked meat. Avoid travel to farms, live animal markets or where animals are slaughtered. Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as cough or runny nose.\"As on January 11, 41 Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) confirmed infection case have been reported from China, of which one has died. One travel related case each has been reported in Thailand and Japan. The clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever with a few patients having difficulty in breathing. The mode of transmission is unclear as of now. However, so far there is little evidence of significant human-to-human transmission.The advisory also said \"All travellers to China, Wuhan city in particular, to monitor their health closely. Cover your mouth while coughing or sneezing, Don\\'t plan travel if sick. Seek medical attention promptly.\"The travellers were also advised to inform the airlines crew about illness and seek a mask from the crew and avoid close contact with family members or fellow travellers if they feel sick on flight, while travelling back to India. The ministry confirmed that they are closely monitoring the situation after the reports of 41 confirmed cases of the nCoV including one death from Wuhan, China on January 5.According to the WHO, the situation is still evolving and preliminary investigations suggest a link to the seafood market. Health Secretary Preeti Sudan said \"We are regularly reviewing the public health preparedness in the country since the news broke out. The public health preparedness is being reviewed on day-to-day basis and the core capacities to timely detect and manage importation of the nCoV into the country are being strengthened further.\"She added \"The situation is being monitored in consultation with WHO and keeping in view the limited human to human transmission the risk at global level is perceived to be low.\" In view of precautionary measures, the Ministry of Health has ordered screening of international travellers from China at designated airports namely, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata through thermal scanners.State governments have also been advised to take necessary precautions. The Ministry is also in touch with the Ministry of External Affairs, and the immigration officers at the airports have been sensitised.-',\n",

       " ['BEIJING - BEIJING - China reported four more cases of pneumonia believed to be caused by a new coronavirus strain, causing rising concern globally that a disease health officials do not yet fully understand could spread during a key holiday period. The new virus, which was discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, belongs in the same large family of coronaviruses that includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China. Though experts say the new virus does not appear to be as lethal as SARS, there is little known about its origins and how easily it can spread. Thailand and Japan have confirmed new cases of the virus earlier this week, stoking worries globally as many of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will travel abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays that begin next week. Authorities around the world including in the United States, Thailand and South Korea have stepped up monitoring of travelers from Wuhan as part of their efforts to prevent the disease from spreading. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has also warned that a wider outbreak is possible, though it has advised against any travel restrictions for China. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WMHC) said on Saturday the four new individuals diagnosed with the new virus are in stable condition, adding it has confirmed 45 cases in the city as of Thursday. A day earlier, the commission confirmed the death of a second patient. Nearly 50 people are now known to have been infected globally, but all of them either live in Wuhan or have traveled to the city. A report published by the London Imperial College\\'s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said there are likely \"substantially more cases\" of the new coronavirus than currently announced by Wuhan authorities: its base scenario estimate is that there would be 1,723 cases showing onset of related symptoms by Jan. 12. The WMHC referred Reuters queries about the report to the National Health Commission (NHC) and the Hubei provincial government, but the NHC and the Hubei government did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province. SCREENING US authorities have said they would start screening at three airports to detect travelers arriving via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan who may have symptoms of the new virus. In Asia, authorities in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have stepped up monitoring of passengers from Wuhan at airports. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines say they have strengthened screening at all points of entry in response to the outbreak, as well. But Alexandra Phelan, global health legal expert at Georgetown University\\'s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said such screening may be insufficient in preventing the virus from spreading as its symptoms, which include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, are \"quite general.\" \"There are likely to be many individuals with matching symptoms due to an illness that is not 2019-nCoV,\" Phelan said, referring to the new virus.',\n",

CDC is screening passengers at two California airports January 17, 2020 04:24 PM ORDER REPRINT →\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is screening passengers at three US airports traveling to and from Wuhan, China after a new virus from the country has infected more than 40 people and led to two deaths.\\nThe CDC will begin screening at John F. Kennedy International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and Los Angeles International airport starting Saturday, according to CNBC.\\nMartin Cetron, the director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, said that the screening will “include as many as 5,000 people” at the airports, CNBC reported.“Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,” he said in a statement. What is the virus? GET OFFER\\nThe virus was first detected on December 12 and scientists identified China’s coronavirus after it affected dozens of people in Wuhan, comparing the virus to the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), according to CNN.\\nThe SARS pandemic killed more than 800 people between 2002 and 2013, according to the World Health Organization.\\nThe Chinese coronavirus was found in 15 of 57 patients with the “pneumonia-like” illness, according to CNN.\\nSymptoms for the virus are not as severe as other coronaviruses and are “primarily fever, with some people experiencing difficulty breathing,” CNN reported. How deadly is it?\\nExperts say that the virus appears to be less deadly than SARS , but that they think that the source is from a mammal because these viruses spread easily from animals to humans, according to the New York Times.\\nTwo people have died so far. On Jan. 15, a 69-year-old man died after going to the hospital with “abnormal renal function and severe damage to multiple organs,” according to the Guardian.\\nThe first person to die from the virus was a 61-year-old man with severe pneumonia and shortness of breath, NBC reported. He died on Jan. 9. Is it spreading?\\nThe virus has already spread to Japan and Thailand , but there are no known US cases, according to the Washington Post.\\nThe World Health Organization said more cases in other countries are “likely” due to “global travel patterns,” according to a press release.\\n“This is a serious situation,” Nancy Messonnier from CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told The Washington Post. “As we do more testing, we’re likely to see more cases, and I think we’ll see at least a case in the United States.” Should you stop traveling to China?\\nAs of now, no.\\nNick Phin of Public Health England told the Financial Times: “The risk to travelers to Wuhan from this disease is low and we are not advising them to change their plans. In order to minimize the risk of transmission, people traveling to the area should maintain good hand and personal hygiene.”\\nThe WHO said that it “advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available on this event,” according to the Financial Times.

The U.N. health agency said a person traveling from Wuhan, China, had been hospitalized in Thailand on January 8 after being diagnosed with mild pneumonia. \"Laboratory testing subsequently confirmed that the novel coronavirus was the cause,\" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP in an email, referring to the new virus. WHO said it might soon host an emergency meeting on the spread of the new virus. The case marks the first outside of China, where 41 people with pneumonia-like symptoms have so far been diagnosed with the new virus in the central city of Wuhan, with one of the victims dying last Thursday. The episode has caused alarm due to the specter of SARS, or Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which in 2002-2003 killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong, whose economy was hit hard by the epidemic\\'s devastating impact on tourism. The WHO has confirmed that the outbreak in China has been caused by a previously unknown type of corona virus, a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS. The agency said Monday it had been informed by Thai health officials that the patient there was recovering from the illness. It stressed that it was not surprising that the virus had spread beyond China. \"The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected, and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,\" it said in a statement. It pointed out that it had issued guidance on how to detect and treat people who fall ill with the new virus, and stressed that China\\'s decision to rapidly share the genetic sequencing of the virus made it possible to quickly diagnose patients.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City to help screen incoming passengers.\\nThe screenings at three airports, which receive most of the travelers from Wuhan to the US on direct and connecting flights, will start Friday evening and Saturday morning.

The popularity of the celebrations worldwide inevitably result in large crowds, where vigilance is recommended, and incidents, from petty crime to social unrest can occur, as well as the risk of illnesses need to be considered.\\nThis year, the official Chinese New Year holiday will commence on 24 January and ends on 30 January.\\nDr Irene Lai, Global Medical Director Medical Information and Analysis at International SOS China, comments, “The Spring Festival holiday coincides with the flu season in the northern hemisphere. There is also a developing situation with a new coronavirus in Wuhan, capital of Central China’s Hubei Province, with dozens of cases of pneumonia . At least two infected people have travelled from Wuhan and been diagnosed at their destination. There are many unknowns, and information is rapidly changing. Travellers are advised to monitor the situation, pay attention to general hygiene , and avoid wet markets.” For the latest information on the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus, clients and members should access the medical alert on the International SOS location guides, and the Pandemic Information Service website.\\nTony Ma, Director of Client Liaison for International SOS, commented, “While China is rated a low travel risk 1 , it is expected that petty crime could surge during the celebrations. This should be anticipated particularly in crowded areas, such as temple fairs, public transport hubs and tourist sites. During the Spring Festival holidays, China’s four first-tier cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, are still the main places of \"tidal departures,\" and the pressure on transportation safety is huge. When travelling, pay attention to the impact of bad weather, possible problems such as the illegal operation of passenger vehicles, the overloading of trucks, the inadequate installation of road safety warning signs in remote areas, the lack of protective facilities in some sections, and relatively weak management capabilities.”\\nMa adds, “Travellers heading to Chinese New Year celebrations around the world should also be aware of these common issues that can affect crowded places.

Chinese authorities report that patients in the outbreak area were exposed to large seafood and meat markets, suggesting an animal-to-person spread of the virus, which was first reported in Wuhan late last month and reportedly spread to Thailand and Japan.Sharing headlinesSome patients reported that they didn\\'t visit any animal markets, suggesting to health officials that the virus has spread through person-to-person contact.The CDC reports that Chinese authorities have reported \"several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are being monitored\" and there are no reports of the virus spreading to health care workers. One hundred health workers are being deployed to assist screenings at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), San Francisco International Airport (SFO), and John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK).CDC staff will supplement existing officials at quarantine stations in those airports.Travellers will be asked to fill out questionnaires about their symptoms, if any, and whether they\\'ve visited seafood or meat markets in the area.Thermal scanners will also be used to detect fevers.Roughly 60,000 people travel from Wuhan into the US each year. JFK and SFO receive direct flights from Wuhan.Coronavirus causes respiratory illnesses like colds and pneumonia. In 2003, a version of a coronavirus led to an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS , which was first discovered in China and spread globally, impacting more than 8,000 people and killing 800.Another coronavirus outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, also known as camel flu, first appeared in the region in 2012 and has been identified in 27 countries. World health organisations report that 30 to 40 per cent of people who were infected with the virus have died.',\n",

Then came SARS —severe acute respiratory syndrome—and suddenly the word became familiar. SARS caused a medical panic. It was an unknown illness with a mortality rate of about 10% and there was a brief period when, having escaped from China, where it first appeared, and surfaced in places as far distant as Canada, it seemed to have the potential to cause a global epidemic. Thankfully, SARS was contained, and now seems to have disappeared in the wild. But the bogeyman status of coronaviruses has not diminished. Hence the mini-panic when a new one began infecting people in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, in China. As The Economist went to press 42 patients had been confirmed as being ill with the new virus, one of whom had died. Already signed up?

The outbreak prompted U.S. health officials to announce Friday that the United States would begin screening airline passengers arriving from central China. Here is what we know about the virus.\\nWhat is the newly identified virus?\\nHealth authorities have identified the virus as a new type of coronavirus, part of a large family of viruses that includes the common cold as well as the more serious illness SARS. Laboratory tests have ruled out all previously known coronaviruses, including SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as influenza and bird flu. Scientists say the new virus strain appears most similar to SARS, but say it seems to be weaker than that disease.\\nHow many people have become sick?\\nTwo people in China have died from the mysterious virus and 41 others have been infected. Chinese officials say five people are in serious condition.\\nWhere has the disease been reported?\\nCases of the virus were first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, believed to be the epicenter of the outbreak. Chinese health officials say many of those who became sick worked at or visited a seafood market in the suburbs of Wuhan. Three cases have been detected outside China - two in Thailand and one in Japan - but health officials say those patients had visited Wuhan before becoming sick.\\nHow does the virus spread?\\nHealth officials believe the virus is spread from animals to humans. There is, so far, no evidence that the virus is capable of human-to-human transmission, although health officials say they cannot rule out this possibility. Scientists say it is also possible that the virus could mutate to become more dangerous.\\nWhat are the virus symptoms?\\nThe most common symptoms of the virus are fever, cough and difficulty breathing.\\nWhat is the U.S. response?\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the risk of the virus to the American public is low, but that it wants to be prepared and so is setting up health screenings at three U.S. airports. The focus will be on travelers to the United States on direct or connecting fights from Wuhan. The CDC said travelers with symptoms arriving at San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports will undergo testing for flu or other possible causes.\\nHow are Asian countries responding?\\nAt least a half-dozen countries in Asia have also started health screenings for incoming airline passengers from central China, including Thailand and Japan, both of which have seen cases of the virus. This time of year is one of the busiest travel seasons in China, with people flying both to and from the country to celebrate the Lunar New Year. China has increased disinfection efforts in major transportation hubs.\\nWhat is the World Health Organization recommending?\\nThe WHO is warning that a wider outbreak of the virus is possible and has given guidance to hospitals worldwide. It said in a statement Thursday that it did not recommend instituting any trade or travel restrictions on China at this time.',\n",

According to Thai authorities, the patient is recovering from the illness. The novel coronavirus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, infecting dozens of people in China and, on Saturday, Chinese media reported the first known death from the virus. Coronaviruses rely on animal to human transmission, and the health commission in Wuhan has reportedly declared that there is no evidence of any spread between humans.\\nHowever, given recent developments, WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is planning to consult with the members of the agency’s Emergency Committee, and could call for a meeting of the Committee at short notice. In its Monday statement, WHO noted that it has been expecting cases to be reported in countries other than China, underscoring the importance of monitoring and preparedness in other countries. The work of the WHO and the Chinese authorities in containing the new coronavirus will be made more complicated by the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, which begins on January 25, and sees hundreds of millions criss-crossing the country. WHO has issued guidance on how to detect and treat persons ill with the new virus: standard recommendations for halting the spread of coronaviruses include regular hand washing; covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing; thoroughly cooking meat and eggs; and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing.\\nWhat is a Coronavirus? Coronaviruses are described by WHO as “a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases”. Probably the best known is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, commonly known as SARS, which broke out in Asia in 2003, and spread to countries in North America, South America and Europe, before being successfully contained later that year. Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and there are several known coronaviruses currently circulating in animals, that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. (UNI)',\n",

At the meeting of the MoH (Photo: moh.gov.vn)\\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH)’s steering committee for the prevention and control of dangerous and emerging diseases held an urgent meeting in Hanoi on January 15 to discuss measures to cope with this disease. The MoH’s General Department of Preventive Medicine said on January 14, the infectious disease monitoring system found two Chinese nationals from Wuhan city to show fever symptoms at Da Nang International Airport. The two have been isolated and placed under close monitoring. Samples from them have been sent to the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang city for testing. Pending testing results, the Health Department of Da Nang city has implemented strict measures to prevent infection at local medical establishments. The MoH has sent a working group to the central city to step up disease prevention and control activities, the general department said. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), cases of acute pneumonia caused by nCoV were reported in Wuhan city of China’s Hubei province. The first patient developed symptoms on December 12, 2019, and the number of cases reached 59 as of January 15, including seven severe cases, one death, two fully recovered, and others in stable condition. There is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Xuan Tuyen said Vietnam hasn’t recorded any cases of infection. However, the entry of this disease into the country is completely possible since Vietnam has constant trading and tourism activities with China. In January and February, the MoH will send more working groups to examine disease prevention and control at hospitals and localities bordering China. It has also ordered localities to take active measures to prevent the disease and stay ready to handle and treat infection cases if there are any. The ministry will also keep close coordination with the WHO to update people on the latest information about this disease, Tuyen added. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of humans and some animals. They can spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions of patients. In humans, coronaviruses cause illnesses in winter and early spring, ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. VNA',\n",
